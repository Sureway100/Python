#  pip install flask -U

#virtualenv ---------------------------------------------------------
# A virtual environment is simply a tool that separates the dependencies of different projects by creating 
# a separate isolated environment for each project.
# If you install two different versions of the same package into your global Python environment, 
# the second installation overwrites the first one. For the same reason, having a single virtual environment for 
# both clients won’t work either. You can’t have two different versions of the same package in a single Python environment.

# <!-- creating virtual environment -->
# pip install virtualenv
# virtualenv simple_django_project
# simple_django_project\Scripts\activate
