# python objects and classes -> class is a blueprint(template) while an object is an instance of a class
#class helps us define how the structure of the object would be
# two characteristics of objects; attributes(names) and behaviours(methods)
# NB THAT SELF OR THIS IS THE INSTANCE CLASS (OBJ) WE ARE REFERRING TO, THIS CALLS THE VALUE OF THE OBJECT KEY 

class Car:
    #----- lets define our class variable (inside the class but outside the constructor), 
    # and when can this be important, when you want to figure out the amount of times your
    # class is called...lets call it public variables
    
    #category = category
    #amount = amount
    
    #create a constructor or what we call instance variable
    def __init__(self, category, amount):

# Inheritance and compositions   -----------------------------------------------------

#inheritance
# Letâ€™s say you have a base class Animal and you derive from it to create a Horse class. 
# The inheritance relationship states that a Horse is an Animal. This means that Horse inherits the interface 
# and implementation of Animal, and Horse objects can be used to replace Animal objects in the application.

class BaseClass:
    pass


class SubClass(BaseClass):
    pass


#composition
# For example, your Horse class can be composed by another object of type Tail. 
# Composition allows you to express that relationship by saying a Horse has a Tail.
# when an attribute in a class, is actually a class as well
